While there is no single universally recognized "most popular" standalone open-source AI agent built exclusively in Rust, several prominent projects provide frameworks and libraries for building agents in Rust, focusing on performance, safety, and scalability.

Key open-source Rust AI agent frameworks include:

- [GraphBit](https://github.com/InfinitiBit/graphbit): This project is noted as the world's first Rust core & Python-wrapped Agentic AI framework, combining Rust's efficiency with Python's ease of use. It is designed for high concurrency and low resource usage, making it suitable for large-scale development.
- [AutoAgents](https://github.com/HKUDS/AutoAgent): Described as a cutting-edge multi-agent framework, AutoAgents is built entirely in Rust and leverages the Ractor model for performance, safety, and scalability in multi-agent systems. It supports cloud-native, edge-native, and hybrid models.
- [Symbiont](https://github.com/ThirdKeyAI/Symbiont): A security-first, AI-native agent framework built entirely in Rust, focused on zero-trust principles to ensure autonomous agents can execute complex workflows securely.
- [AgentAI](https://github.com/AdamStrojek/rust-agentai): A Rust library that simplifies the creation of AI agents by providing an interface to a wide range of Large Language Models (LLMs) via the GenAI library, benefiting from Rust's strong typing and error handling.
- [Goose](https://github.com/block/goose): An open-source, extensible, on-machine AI agent capable of automating complex development tasks, including building projects, debugging, and orchestrating workflows. It is available as a desktop app and CLI and works with any LLM.

Many popular AI agents are available as general-purpose coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Aider) that support Rust within larger, language-agnostic ecosystems. For those building AI agents or working on machine learning projects in Rust, the awesome-rust-llm GitHub repository provides a curated list of relevant tools and libraries

### does the goose-cli need to run the goose-server

No, the Goose CLI does not need to run the Goose Server. The CLI operates autonomously on its own and uses its built-in tools for basic functionality, as explained in the Goose CLI providers documentation. However, if you need to use Goose's advanced features like extensions or MCP servers, you would need to configure them separately.

#### CLI vs. Server

- Goose CLI: The command-line interface is self-contained and can execute basic tasks on its own.
- Goose Server: The "Goose Server" is a broader term referring to the extensions or MCP servers that provide advanced functionality. These are not required for the CLI to function but are necessary to access certain integrations.

#### How to use Goose with extensions
- Install the CLI: Install the Goose CLI on your system.
- Configure extensions: Install and configure extensions separately to add more functionality.
